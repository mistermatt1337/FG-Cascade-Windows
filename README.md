Cascade Windows by Mister Motaye

This extension adds a new feature to cascade all open windows in Fantasy Grounds VTT, making it easier to manage multiple windows at once. It works on both host/DM and client/player, with each being able to tailor their own settings. Use the chat command ccw or cascadewindows if you want to type it or drag it to the hotbar. Use the Cascade All right dock button near the bottom to click it on FGC. Use the sidebar icon button at the top and click on FGU.
